Duolingo is an application used to teach users various languages by showing words
of a language the user wants to learn and then testing the user through a plethora of
methods, one of which is showing a given word from the language to the user at
different intervals of time.

We’ve attempted to test the intelligent tutoring system (ITS), which tries to predict
how probable it is for the user to guess a given word correctly in the future. The
results would be used to gauge how effective the ITS was in fulfilling its purpose.
We have done this by calculating the parameter ‘p_recall’ value, which is the ratio
of how often a user gets the word correct to how many times the user has been
shown the word.The data set we’ve used contains information about a large set of words taken from
the app Duolingo. The dataset includes information on how often users have seen
the word in the past, how many times users have seen a word in a current session
and the probability of a user getting the particular word correct while being tested.
Additionally, this program could be extended to predict how difficult it would be to
guess a given word.
